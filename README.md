# My Docker Repository

This repo and in turn the data contained are those required for personal projects including my BSc Bioinformatics (Data Science) Dissertation.

This repo is not automates due to the complicated nature of building and pushing multiple images in one repo.

Due to how I have set this up, all containers will be here: `https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/dlbpointon/my_containers`
